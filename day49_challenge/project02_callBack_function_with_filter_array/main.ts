// *Question 146:* Show an example of a callback function used to filter an array of numbers.

// *Explain & TIP:* The .filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. This method is commonly used to search through an array and create a subset of it based on certain criteria.

const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,11,12,13,14,15];

const filteredNumbers: number[] = numbers.filter((number) => number > 5);

console.log(filteredNumbers);
