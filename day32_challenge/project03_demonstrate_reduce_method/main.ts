// *Question 96:* Demonstrate how to use the .reduce() method to calculate the sum of all numbers in an array.

// *Explain & TIP:* The .reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right)
//  to reduce it to a single value.


function calculateSum(numbers: number[]): number {
    return numbers.reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0);
}

// Example: Calculating the sum of an array of numbers
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(calculateSum(numbers));
