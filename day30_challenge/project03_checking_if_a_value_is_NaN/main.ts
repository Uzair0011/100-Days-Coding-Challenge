//Question 90:* Checking if a Value is NaN: Demonstrate how to check if a 
//variable's value is NaN (Not a Number) and return a boolean result.
//Explain & TIP:* isNaN() helps you figure out if something that's supposed
//to be a number didn't turn out to be a number. It's useful for validating
//inputs or results of calculations.

function isValueNaN(value: any): boolean {
   return isNaN(value); 
}
console.log(isValueNaN("Uzair Ahmed")); 
console.log(isValueNaN(12345));
